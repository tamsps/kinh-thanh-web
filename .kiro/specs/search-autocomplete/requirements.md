# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive search interface for an ASP.NET Core application using Clean Architecture principles in .NET 9. The system provides real-time autocomplete functionality as users type, displaying suggested results below the textbox, with configurable search filters to refine results. The interface consists of a search textbox, search button, and filter checkboxes to enhance the user search experience. After the user clicks the search button, the application will look up matching results in its database and display them below with pagination support. The system includes comprehensive exception handling, logging capabilities, and a complete test suite using NUnit. Third-party libraries may be used to support autocomplete functionality or pagination as needed. 

The primary data model will be KinhThanh with properties: Content, Section, From, To, Type, and Author. A separate Section model will be created to store section information that KinhThanh can reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to type text in a search box and see autocomplete suggestions, so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for without typing the complete search term.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user types at least 2 characters in the search textbox THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown list of autocomplete suggestions
2. WHEN the user continues typing THEN the system SHALL update the autocomplete suggestions in real-time
3. WHEN the user clicks on an autocomplete suggestion THEN the system SHALL populate the search textbox with the selected suggestion
4. WHEN the user presses the escape key THEN the system SHALL hide the autocomplete dropdown
5. IF no matching suggestions are found THEN the system SHALL display "No suggestions found" message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to execute a search by clicking a search button, so that I can retrieve results based on my search criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the search button THEN the system SHALL execute a search using the current textbox value
2. WHEN the search is executed THEN the system SHALL display search results below the search interface
3. WHEN the search textbox is empty and the user clicks search THEN the system SHALL display a validation message
4. WHEN a search is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator on the search button

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use filter checkboxes to refine my search criteria, so that I can narrow down results to specific categories or types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects one or more filter checkboxes THEN the system SHALL apply those filters to both autocomplete suggestions and search results
2. WHEN filter checkboxes are changed THEN the system SHALL update autocomplete suggestions immediately if text is present
3. WHEN no filters are selected THEN the system SHALL search across all available categories
4. WHEN the user executes a search THEN the system SHALL apply the selected filters to the search results
5. IF filters are applied THEN the system SHALL display which filters are currently active

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow Clean Architecture principles, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the search functionality THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
2. WHEN creating the search service THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection for loose coupling
3. WHEN handling data access THEN the system SHALL implement repository pattern in the Infrastructure layer
4. WHEN processing search logic THEN the system SHALL implement business rules in the Domain layer
5. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL implement controllers in the Presentation layer that delegate to Application services

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search interface to be responsive and performant, so that I have a smooth user experience across different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the search interface on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display properly formatted and touch-friendly controls
2. WHEN autocomplete requests are made THEN the system SHALL debounce requests to avoid excessive API calls
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL display them within 2 seconds under normal conditions
4. WHEN the user types rapidly THEN the system SHALL cancel previous autocomplete requests to prioritize the latest input
5. IF the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and gracefully degrade functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate through search results efficiently, so that I can browse large result sets without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search results exceed 10 items THEN the system SHALL implement pagination controls
2. WHEN the user clicks on pagination controls THEN the system SHALL load the next/previous page of results
3. WHEN displaying paginated results THEN the system SHALL show current page number and total pages
4. WHEN loading a new page THEN the system SHALL maintain the current search criteria and filters
5. IF there are no search results THEN the system SHALL display "No results found" message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that issues can be diagnosed and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any exception occurs during search operations THEN the system SHALL log the error with appropriate detail level
2. WHEN database connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle the exception gracefully and display user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
4. WHEN logging search operations THEN the system SHALL include search terms, filters applied, and response times
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them at ERROR level while maintaining user session

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that the system is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing search functionality THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all service classes using NUnit
2. WHEN creating API endpoints THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for all search endpoints
3. WHEN implementing autocomplete features THEN the system SHALL include tests for debouncing and cancellation logic
4. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL include tests for exception handling and logging
5. WHEN running the test suite THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage for search-related components
